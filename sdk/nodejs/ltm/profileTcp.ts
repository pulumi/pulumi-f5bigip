/**
 * `f5bigip.ltm.ProfileTcp` Configures a custom TCP LTM Profile for use by health checks.
 *
 * Resources should be named with their `full path`. The full path is the combination of the `partition + name` (example: /Common/my-pool ) or  `partition + directory + name` of the resource  (example: /Common/test/my-pool )
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as f5bigip from "@pulumi/f5bigip";
 *
 * const sanjose_tcp_lan_profile = new f5bigip.ltm.ProfileTcp("sanjose-tcp-lan-profile", {
 *     name: "/Common/sanjose-tcp-lan-profile",
 *     idleTimeout: 200,
 *     closeWaitTimeout: 5,
 *     finwait2timeout: 5,
 *     finwaitTimeout: 300,
 *     keepaliveInterval: 1700,
 *     deferredAccept: "enabled",
 *     fastOpen: "enabled",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Importing
 *
 * An existing tcp profile can be imported into this resource by supplying tcp profile Name in `full path` as `id`.
 * An example is below:
 * ```sh
 * $ terraform import bigip_ltm_profile_tcp.tcp-lan-profile-import /Common/test-tcp-lan-profile
 * ```
