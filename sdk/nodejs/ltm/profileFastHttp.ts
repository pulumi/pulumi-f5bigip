/**
 * `bigip_ltm_profile_fasthttp` Configures a custom profile_fasthttp for use by health checks.
 * 
 * For resources should be named with their "full path". The full path is the combination of the partition + name of the resource. For example /Common/my-pool.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as f5bigip from "@pulumi/f5bigip";
 * 
 * const bigip_ltm_profile_fasthttp_sjfasthttpprofile = new f5bigip.ltm.ProfileFastHttp("sjfasthttpprofile", {
 *     connpoolMaxreuse: 2,
 *     connpoolMaxsize: 2048,
 *     connpoolMinsize: 0,
 *     connpoolReplenish: "enabled",
 *     connpoolStep: 4,
 *     connpoolidleTimeoutoverride: 0,
 *     defaultsFrom: "/Common/fasthttp",
 *     forcehttp10response: "disabled",
 *     idleTimeout: 300,
 *     maxheaderSize: 32768,
 *     name: "sjfasthttpprofile",
 * });
 * ```
